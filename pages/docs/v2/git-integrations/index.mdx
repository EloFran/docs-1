​​<ProductName /> provides integrations for your [GitHub](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github), [GitLab](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-gitlab), and [Bitbucket](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-bitbucket) projects, allowing for **automatic deployments on every branch push** and merge to the [Production Branch](#production-branch).

The <ProductName /> Git Integrations provide the following benefits:

- [Preview Deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#preview) for every push.
- [Production Deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#production) for the most recent changes from the [Production Branch](#production-branch).
- Instant rollbacks when reverting changes assigned to a custom domain.

The easiest way to use a Git Integration is to think of your **`main` branch as production**. Every time a pull/merge request is made to that branch, <ProductName /> will **create a unique deployment**, allowing you to **view the changes in a preview environment before merging**.

In this case, `main` is the Production Branch. When merging to the Production Branch, a **Production Deployment** is made, making the latest changes available to assigned custom domains automatically.

You can choose to use a different branch as the [Production Branch](#production-branch).

## Available Integrations

## Quick Installation

You can install any Git Integration directly from your dashboard by clicking ["Import Project"](/import) followed by ["Import Git Repository"](/import/git). Then enter the URL of your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository to connect and import it.

## Deploying Private Git Repositories

In order to deploy commits from a private Git Repository (or a fork of a private Git Repository) under a Team, the commit author has to be a member of the Team on <ProductName /> (even if the commit author is a bot).

If the commit author is not a member, the Deployment will be prevented and a request to join the Team will automatically be issued for the commit author. After that, the owners of the Team will be notified and can either accept or decline the membership request on the "Members" page in the Team Settings.

Declining the request will leave the commit undeployed. If the commit author gets accepted as a member of the Team, however, their most recent commit will resume to be deployed to <ProductName /> automatically.

Commit authors will automatically be considered a part of the Team on <ProductName /> if one of the existing members connected their Personal Account on <ProductName /> with the Git account that created the commit.

## Production Branch

A [Production Deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#production) will be created each time you merge to the **Production Branch**.

### Default Configuration

When you create a new Project from a Git repository on <ProductName />, the Production Branch will be selected in the following order:

- The `main` branch.
- If not present, the `master` branch ([more details](https://vercel.com/blog/production-branch-setting#a-note-on-the-master-branch)).
- [Only for Bitbucket] If not present, the "Production Branch" setting of your Git repository is used.
- If not present, the Git repository's default branch.

### Customizing the Production Branch

On the **Git Integration** page in the **Project Settings**, you can change your Production Branch to be one of the following:

- The `main` branch.
- The Git repository's default branch (for Bitbucket, the Git repository's "Production Branch" setting is considered).
- Any other custom branch of your choice.

Whenever a new commit is then pushed to the branch you configured here, a [Production Deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#production) will be created for you.

## Monorepos

You can have multiple Projects that are connected to the same Git repository.
Every branch push and merge will trigger deployments for all the connected projects.

To start, you can create all your Projects by [importing the Git repository](/docs/v2/git-integrations#quick-installation) multiple times.
Each time you can select the Root Directory of one Project. It's also allowed to use the same Root Directory for multiple Projects.

Once all the Projects are created, they're all connected to the same monorepo.

Every push will now automatically create Deployments for all the Projects, as well as comment on Pull Requests and commits with status updates.

Currently, only the **GitHub Integration** supports this feature and [up to 20 Projects](/docs/v2/platform/frequently-asked-questions#repository-connection-limitation) can be connected to the same repository. [Contact us](/support/request) if you have custom needs.
